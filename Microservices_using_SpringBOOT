Monolithic Application:- A monolithic architecture is the traditional unified model for the design of a software program. Monolithic, in this context,
                         means composed all in one piece.
                         In a tightly-coupled architecture, each component and its associated components must be present in order for code to be executed or compiled.
    -these are self contained and independent from each other computing application
    -it is deployed as a single monolithic application , it has a single WAR file that runs on a web container(Tomcat)
    -till now what we have created all application are monolithic
